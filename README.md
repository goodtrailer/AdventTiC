# AdventTiC
Advent of Ascension integration mod for Tinkers' Construct 1.16.5

AoA had TiC integration in MC 1.12.2, but since TiC is still only in alpha for 1.16.5, that integration hasn't been ported. This is a temporary stopgap for one of my modpacks until Tslat re-implements TiC integration for 1.16.5.
