# AdventTiC
[Advent of Ascension](https://adventofascension.fandom.com/wiki/Advent_of_Ascension_Wiki) integration mod for [Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) 1.16.5.

AoA had TiC integration in MC 1.12.2, but since TiC is still only in alpha for 1.16.5, that integration hasn't been ported. This is a temporary stopgap for one of my modpacks until Tslat re-implements TiC integration for 1.16.5.

The stats are based on values from the [official wiki](https://adventofascension.fandom.com/wiki/Third-Party_Mod_Integration/Tinker%27s_Construct), though some of those values seem to conflict with values from the [1.12.2 source](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/tree/f6e05fc886ddc3d391a5f54e893cbdf9859ea939/source/hooks/tconstruct).
